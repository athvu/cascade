# Modules
Modules are made up of domains, resources, traits (still in development) and other modules.
They are the building blocks for larger scale policy and are a core compnent of a System.
The user can declare multiple modules and decide which ones to build.
This not only simplifies the process of policy building for users, but also allows for customizability and scalability.
